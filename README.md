It supports user authentication, rate-limited API access, and integrates caching with Redis for optimized performance. This project provides an efficient and scalable solution for interacting with GitHub repositories, retrieving issue data, and offering a secure, API-driven interface.  Key features include:  Async fetching of GitHub issues using aiohttp  User authentication with JWT  Database integration with PostgreSQL  Redis caching for improved performance  Rate-limiting for API calls

Configure Redis (if using Redis for caching):

Install and configure Redis on your system or use a hosted Redis service.

Create the database:

Set up the database (PostgreSQL, as mentioned in your code).

Run any necessary database migrations if required.

Run the application:

Start the Flask app by running the script that contains the Flask initialization.

The app should run on your local machine, typically accessible at http://127.0.0.1:5000.
